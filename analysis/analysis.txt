Question 1: are the benchmark timings for StringStrand consistent with 
the explanation below that the time to execute cutAndSplice is O(b2S)?

Question 2: are the benchmark timings for StringBuilderStrand consistent 
with the explanation below that the time to execute cutAndSplice is O(bS)?

Question 3: Explain why the time for LinkStrand does not change much at 
all over all the runs in the benchmark program. Explain why you think memory 
is exhausted at the specific strand size you see in your timings -- as compared 
to exhaustion for String and StringBuilder.
